# Tic-Tac-Toe
The following task is part of my internship for Prodigy Infotech. The task was to construct the tic-tac-toe game, with the options of playing against a human and a CPU. For the CPU version of the game, I used the minimax algorithm, so that the game becomes hard for the player. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this task.\
